            <p>Monorepo is an approach in managing source code under a product, team or company within a single repo as oppose to multi-repo where a single product/application is contained within its own git repository.</p>
<p>The two approaches has its own pro&rsquo;s and con&rsquo;s. In this article i will not be discussing on what is the best approach as it entirely matters on the context we work, rather i will walk the through the challenges of Automated CI/CD with <strong>mono-repo</strong> and how we can over come them with structure and some magic with <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/">Jenkins Pipeline</a>.</p>
<h2 id="challenges">Challenges</h2>
<p>Due to the nature of multiple applications residing in a single repo it is not trivial to setup a CI/CD job that detects changes and executes only the <strong>impacted applications related CI/CD job</strong>. Some of the steps that contain in a typical pipeline are,</p>
<ul>
<li>Building the code</li>
<li>Running automated tests</li>
<li>Creating and versioning a deployable artifact</li>
<li>Deploying that artifact</li>
</ul>
<p>Lets look at how we can tackle this problem with Jenkins.</p>
<h2 id="some-jenkins-magic">Some Jenkins Magic</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>sample structure in a mono-repo setup with jenkins pipeline</em></p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>.
├── src                                 
    ├── react-app
        ├── Jenkinsfile     
    ├── node-app
        ├── Jenkinsfile                                                               
└── Jenkinsfile                 # main jenkinsfile
</code></pre>
<p>If we consider a structure like above, with jenkins we could setup the main Jenkinsfile in the root of the repository as a <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-multibranch-pipeline-project/">multi-branch jenkins job</a>. This job can be connected with your remote repository such that it triggers via a webhook when a PR is merged to your mainline branch. You can get creative with the triggers depending on the workflow your team follows.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>A stage inside the main Jenkinsfile is shown below</em></p>
</blockquote>
<pre><code>stage('Execute Jobs') {
    failFast false
    parallel {
        stage('react-app ci') {
            when {
                changeset &quot;src/react-app/**&quot;
            }
            steps {
                build job: &quot;react-app-job&quot;, parameters: [string(name: 'branch_name', value: env.BRANCH_NAME)]
            }
        }
        stage('node-app ci') {
            when {
                changeset &quot;src/node-app/**&quot;
            }
            steps {
                build job: &quot;node-app-job&quot;, parameters: [string(name: 'branch_name', value: env.BRANCH_NAME)]
            }
        }
    }
}

</code></pre><p>In the above example the <strong>changeset</strong> condition walks through the git changelog for that particular change and checks if there is any change within the given path. If a change is detected then the <strong>build job</strong> step executes the related jenkins job.</p>
<p>Note - <em><strong>failFast</strong> is set to false to avoid failure of the entire pipeline if one job fails.</em></p>
<p>Once we have this setup we can go about and setup separate pipeline jobs for each application in the repository.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Below is an example on how the main multi-branch job will look in Jenkins</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="/img/jenkins-multi-main.png" alt="jenkins-multi-main.png">
In the above image the multi-branch job has executed when a change has been pushed to the master branch. When we navigate into the master branch execution we can see the pipeline as shown below,</p>
<p><img src="/img/jenkins-multi-stage-view.png" alt="jenkins-multi-stage-view.png"></p>
<p>In the stage view we can see that build #9 contains changes only for 1 application and build #10 contains changes for both.</p>
<p>This is an awesome and quick setup with Jenkins for a monorepo. I&rsquo;m a big fan of Jenkins due to its flexibility and extensibility specially with declarative <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/">Jenkins Pipeline</a>.</p>
